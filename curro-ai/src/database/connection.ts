/**
 * Open (creating if needed) the SQLite database and apply the performance PRAGMAs.

 * Tuning rationale (validated for extreme-throughput streaming):
 * - `journal_mode = WAL`         — Write-Ahead Logging: writers never block readers and
 *                                  appends are sequential I/O, so concurrent streams and
 *                                  UI reads never contend.
 * - `synchronous = NORMAL`       — decouples fsync from the application thread; with WAL
 *                                  this is durable against app crashes and loses at most
 *                                  the last checkpoint window on power loss.
 * - `cache_size = -64000`        — exactly 64MB of page cache in RAM, keeping hot index
 *                                  pages memory-resident as the database grows.
 * - `locking_mode = EXCLUSIVE`   — locks the file to this process, removing OS
 *                                  lock/unlock syscalls from every transaction.
 * - `temp_store = MEMORY`        — temp tables/indices never touch disk.
 * - `mmap_size = 256MB`          — reads go through the OS page cache via mmap instead
 *                                  of read() syscalls.
 * - `wal_autocheckpoint = 2000`  — larger checkpoint interval (~8MB WAL) so checkpoints
 *                                  are rare; an idle-time PASSIVE checkpoint in
 *                                  maintenance.ts keeps the WAL small without ever
 *                                  stalling a writer.
 * - `busy_timeout = 5000`        — belt-and-braces; with exclusive locking it never fires.
 * - `foreign_keys = ON`          — referential integrity for cascading deletes.
